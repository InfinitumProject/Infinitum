# What is Infinitum and why am I making it?

Infinitum is a project about making a multipurpose engine for tech demos and gaming. Currently it is in the very earliest stage of development, where I am developing the bare bones of it. As of now my idea of the bare bones consists of a renderer and a basic GUI API for Infinitum. I hope to have others collaborate on this project to create an open source engine capable of many things. To be honest I really want to make something, and I figure what better to make than something that will help me—and others hopefully—make more things that we enjoy. That is the goal of Infinitum; I hope it will be the Engine of Creation.

# Future plans
I hope in the future that I will have developed an extensive API and C++ library for infinitum that will allow it to be used by anyone of any skill level. One of the ideas that I have is to make different levels of API and library that can be used, and encourage users to look at the source code to find how these functions work. Because higher levels of library would be built with the lower levels of the library this should allow users to more easily tweak control vs user frendliness to their liking, although I suspect that this would have an effect on compilation times that is irrelivant because at the time of writing this I can't even begin to think about compilation times as the project isn't in a state to be compiled for anything useful at all. In short, I'll figure it out as it develops.
